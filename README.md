# Divercitychallenge
We would like you to create a basic jobs platform that allows users to view available jobs, and apply for them

Context :
The application should implement the following user stories:

As a user, I should be able to list all available job openings.
As a user, I should be able to filter jobs based on location, job_type, skills_tags.
As a user, I should be able to apply to a job, but if am not logged in it should show me an error message that says that i am not logged in, and give me the possibility to go to login/register.
As a user, I can login with my credentials.
As a user, I can register with a new account.
As a logged user, I should be able to apply to available jobs
Requirements :
The app should be built with ReactJS.
The app should communicate with our mock api (details below).
No UI library can be used (be creative, make your own styling ðŸ˜Ž).
The app should validates user inputs, and show error messages in case of missing fields in registration/login/job application forms.
Nice to have :
It would be a plus if you use :

Routing between pages.
Styled components.
Unit tests.
Elegant and polished code.
API :
The app should use our mock api, you can find the documentation here : API DOCS

Deliverables:
Put your code on a public repository and send us the link, with instructions to run the project.
Deploy the code to a platform like Heroku will be a great plus.
